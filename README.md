# Online Mousetracking Experiment about Categorization of Atypical exemplars


## Welcome to the Final Project of Group 7 for the Class "Experimental Psychology Lab" 
Summer Term 2020, University of Osnabrück


## The Experiment

This study replicates Experiment 1 from “Graded motor responses in the time course of categorizing atypical exemplars” by Dick Dale, Caitlin Kehoe and Michael J. Spivey published in the journal ‘Memory & Cognition’ in 2007 (35(1), 15-28). This replication in the form of a browser-based mouse tracking study is entirely based on the information provided in the mentioned paper.

For more detailed information, please see the Experimental Design, the Pre-registration Report and the Final Report in the documents section of this repository.
